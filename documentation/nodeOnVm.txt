Getting node to run on VM notes: 
	can have any directory structure in your repo on your vm: everything will be served from: 
		https://<FQDN>/node
	navigate to directory on VM where you are storing you server.js file (the new 'project')
	run 'sudo npm init' within that directory 
	enter through all prompts 
	type yes
	'sudo npm install express' within that directory 
	type 'node server' 
	'Listening on *:3000' should pop up 
	open web-browser and navigate 'to https://<FQDN>/node'
	from here, your file structure should be the same as when you test locally, just substitute the URL in this way: 
		sub 'http://localhost:3000/' for 'https://<FQDN>/node'. Example: 
			http://localhost:3000/itws/4500 = https://<FQDN>/node/itws/4500
		
	'sudo npm install fs' because had to do it locally 
	chmod 777 Projects.json so that I could edit file 
	Everything should be served correctly from there
